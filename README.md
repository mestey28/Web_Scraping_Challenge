# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars

In this assignment, you will build a web application that scrapes various websites 
for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

## Step 1 - Scraping
NASA Mars News

Scrape the NASA Mars News Site and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text

## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application
Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

## Step 3 - Submission
To submit your work to BootCampSpot, create a new GitHub repository and upload the following:
The Jupyter Notebook containing the scraping code used.
Screenshots of your final application.
Submit the link to your new repository to BootCampSpot.
Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file


## Hints
Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.
Use Pymongo for CRUD applications for your database. For this homework, you can simply overwrite the existing document each time the /scrape url is visited and new data is obtained.
Use Bootstrap to structure your HTML template.
